/*
 Line Following with Pause
 
 As the robot has two processors, one to command the motors and one to
 take care of the screen and user input, it is possible to write 
 programs that put one part of the robot to do something and get the
 other half to control it.

 This example shows how the Control Board assigns the Motor one to
 follow a line, but asks it to stop every 3 seconds.
