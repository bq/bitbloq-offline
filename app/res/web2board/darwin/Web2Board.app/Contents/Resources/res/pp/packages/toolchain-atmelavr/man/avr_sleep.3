Use of the \fCSLEEP\fP instruction can allow an application to reduce its power comsumption considerably\&. AVR devices can be put into different sleep modes\&. Refer to the datasheet for the details relating to the device you are using\&.
.PP
There are several macros provided in this header file to actually put the device into sleep mode\&. The simplest way is to optionally set the desired sleep mode using \fCset_sleep_mode()\fP (it usually defaults to idle mode where the CPU is put on sleep but all peripheral clocks are still running), and then call \fCsleep_mode()\fP\&. This macro automatically sets the sleep enable bit, goes to sleep, and clears the sleep enable bit\&.
.PP
Example: 
.PP
.nf
    #include <avr/sleep\&.h>

    \&.\&.\&.
      set_sleep_mode(<mode>);
      sleep_mode();

.fi
.PP

Note that unless your purpose is to completely lock the CPU (until a hardware reset), interrupts need to be enabled before going to sleep\&.
.PP
As the \fCsleep_mode()\fP macro might cause race conditions in some situations, the individual steps of manipulating the sleep enable (SE) bit, and actually issuing the \fCSLEEP\fP instruction, are provided in the macros \fC\fBsleep_enable()\fP\fP, \fC\fBsleep_disable()\fP\fP, and \fC\fBsleep_cpu()\fP\fP\&. This also allows for test-and-sleep scenarios that take care of not missing the interrupt that will awake the device from sleep\&.
.PP
Example: 
.PP
.nf
    #include <avr/interrupt\&.h>
    #include <avr/sleep\&.h>

    \&.\&.\&.
      set_sleep_mode(<mode>);
      cli();
      if (some_condition)
      {
        sleep_enable();
        sei();
        sleep_cpu();
        sleep_disable();
      }
      sei();

This sequence ensures an atomic test of \fCsome_condition\fP with interrupts being disabled\&. If the condition is met, sleep mode will be prepared, and the \fCSLEEP\fP instruction will be scheduled immediately after an \fCSEI\fP instruction\&. As the intruction right after the \fCSEI\fP is guaranteed to be executed before an interrupt could trigger, it is sure the device will really be put to sleep\&.
.PP
Some devices have the ability to disable the Brown Out Detector (BOD) before going to sleep\&. This will also reduce power while sleeping\&. If the specific AVR device has this ability then an additional macro is defined: \fCsleep_bod_disable()\fP\&. This macro generates inlined assembly code that will correctly implement the timed sequence for disabling the BOD before sleeping\&. However, there is a limited number of cycles after the BOD has been disabled that the device can be put into sleep mode, otherwise the BOD will not truly be disabled\&. Recommended practice is to disable the BOD (\fCsleep_bod_disable()\fP), set the interrupts (\fC\fBsei()\fP\fP), and then put the device to sleep (\fC\fBsleep_cpu()\fP\fP), like so:
.PP
.PP
.nf
    #include <avr/interrupt\&.h>
    #include <avr/sleep\&.h>

    \&.\&.\&.
      set_sleep_mode(<mode>);
      cli();
      if (some_condition)
      {
        sleep_enable();
        sleep_bod_disable();
        sei();
        sleep_cpu();
        sleep_disable();
      }
      sei();

.SH "Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "void \fBsleep_cpu\fP (void)"Put the device into sleep mode\&. The SE bit must be set beforehand, and it is recommended to clear it afterwards\&. 
.SS "void \fBsleep_disable\fP (void)"Clear the SE (sleep enable) bit\&. 
.SS "void \fBsleep_enable\fP (void)"Put the device in sleep mode\&. How the device is brought out of sleep mode depends on the specific mode selected with the set_sleep_mode() function\&. See the data sheet for your device for more details\&.
.PP
Set the SE (sleep enable) bit\&.
