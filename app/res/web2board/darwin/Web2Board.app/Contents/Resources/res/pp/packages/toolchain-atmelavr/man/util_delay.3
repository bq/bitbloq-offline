As an alternative method, it is possible to pass the F_CPU macro down to the compiler from the Makefile\&. Obviously, in that case, no \fC#define\fP statement should be used\&.

.PP
The functions in this header file are wrappers around the basic busy-wait functions from <\fButil/delay_basic\&.h\fP>\&. They are meant as convenience functions where actual time values can be specified rather than a number of cycles to wait for\&. The idea behind is that compile-time constant expressions will be eliminated by compiler optimization so floating-point expressions can be used to calculate the number of delay cycles needed based on the CPU frequency passed by the macro F_CPU\&.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
In order for these functions to work as intended, compiler optimizations \fImust\fP be enabled, and the delay time \fImust\fP be an expression that is a known constant at compile-time\&. If these requirements are not met, the resulting delay will be much longer (and basically unpredictable), and applications that otherwise do not use floating-point calculations will experience severe code bloat by the floating-point library routines linked into the application\&.
.RE
.PP
The functions available allow the specification of microsecond, and millisecond delays directly, using the application-supplied macro F_CPU as the CPU clock frequency (in Hertz)\&.

.PP 
.SS "void \fB_delay_ms\fP (double__ms)"Perform a delay of \fC__ms\fP milliseconds, using \fB_delay_loop_2()\fP\&.
.PP
The macro F_CPU is supposed to be defined to a constant defining the CPU clock frequency (in Hertz)\&.
.PP
The maximal possible delay is 262\&.14 ms / F_CPU in MHz\&.
.PP
When the user request delay which exceed the maximum possible one, \fB_delay_ms()\fP provides a decreased resolution functionality\&. In this mode \fB_delay_ms()\fP will work with a resolution of 1/10 ms, providing delays up to 6\&.5535 seconds (independent from CPU frequency)\&. The user will not be informed about decreased resolution\&.
.PP
If the avr-gcc toolchain has __builtin_avr_delay_cycles(unsigned long) support, maximal possible delay is 4294967\&.295 ms/ F_CPU in MHz\&. For values greater than the maximal possible delay, overflows results in no delay i\&.e\&., 0ms\&.
.PP
Conversion of __us into clock cycles may not always result in integer\&. By default, the clock cycles rounded up to next integer\&. This ensures that the user gets atleast __us microseconds of delay\&.
.PP
Alternatively, user can define __DELAY_ROUND_DOWN__ and __DELAY_ROUND_CLOSEST__ to round down and round to closest integer\&.
.PP
Note: The new implementation of \fB_delay_ms(double __ms)\fP with __builtin_avr_delay_cycles(unsigned long) support is not backward compatible\&. User can define __DELAY_BACKWARD_COMPATIBLE__ to get a backward compatible delay\&. Also, the backward compatible algorithm will be chosen if the code is compiled in a \fIfreestanding environment\fP (GCC option \fC-ffreestanding\fP), as the math functions required for rounding are not available to the compiler then\&. 
.SS "void \fB_delay_us\fP (double__us)"Perform a delay of \fC__us\fP microseconds, using \fB_delay_loop_1()\fP\&.
.PP
The macro F_CPU is supposed to be defined to a constant defining the CPU clock frequency (in Hertz)\&.
.PP
The maximal possible delay is 768 us / F_CPU in MHz\&.
.PP
If the user requests a delay greater than the maximal possible one, \fB_delay_us()\fP will automatically call \fB_delay_ms()\fP instead\&. The user will not be informed about this case\&.
.PP
If the avr-gcc toolchain has __builtin_avr_delay_cycles(unsigned long) support, maximal possible delay is 4294967\&.295 us/ F_CPU in MHz\&. For values greater than the maximal possible delay, overflow results in no delay i\&.e\&., 0us\&.
