    The NXP LPC is a family of 32-bit microcontroller integrated circuits
    by NXP Semiconductors. The LPC chips are grouped into related series
    that are based around the same 32-bit ARM processor core, such as the
    Cortex-M4F, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M0+, or Cortex-M0. Internally, each
    microcontroller consists of the processor core, static RAM memory,
    flash memory, debugging interface, and various peripherals.
