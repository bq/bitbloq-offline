    """
    The STM32 family of 32-bit Flash MCUs based on the ARM Cortex-M
    processor is designed to offer new degrees of freedom to MCU users.
    It offers a 32-bit product range that combines very high performance,
    real-time capabilities, digital signal processing, and low-power,
    low-voltage operation, while maintaining full integration and ease of
    development.
