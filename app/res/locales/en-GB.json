This makes programming accessible to kids, as they don´t have to worry about the syntax (i.e. they don´t need to learn how to write code in a literal programming language such as Processing, C++ or Java). Bitbloq uses this paradigm because it has been proven to be effective among children, and also because Scratch is already used in many schools and education centres. Our philosophy is that it´s better to join forces than to reinvent the wheel. We have developed Bitbloq using open source software libraries, primarily ","landing-fifth-text-title-first-firstlink":"Blockly","landing-fifth-text-title-first-second":", a library developed by Google for creating online applications using using blocks. That´s why tools similar to Bitbloq exist, such as","landing-fifth-text-title-first-secondlink":" BlocklyDuino","landing-fifth-text-title-first-third":". As with Bitbloq, these tools are all open source and can be freely used and modified by users and developers.","landing-fifth-text-title-fourth":"Can Bitbloq and Scratch be used for the same purpose?","landing-fifth-text-fourth":"Both serve to bring kids closer to the world of programming and to make learning how to program fun for them. In addition, they both use the same block-structured programming paradigm and most of the control blocks (If... Do, While... Do, etc.) are shared. However, they are used for different applications: Scratch is aimed at computer application programming (primarily video games) whereas Bitbloq is for controller board programming (mainly robots and home inventions). The two complement each other perfectly for teaching children how to program through a wide variety of projects, being different but compatible at the same time, and serving as excellent educative tools.","landing-fifth-text-title-second":"Can video games be made using Bitbloq?","landing-fifth-text-second":"It´s not possible to make video games on the computer, but it can be done using electronics with My First Robotics Kit, or any other electronics that use Zum or another board compatible with Arduino. Scratch has been designed to teach to kids to program by making video games, whereas Bitbloq is designed to teach to them through electronics, by creating robotics projects, domotics and home inventions, etc.","landing-fifth-text-title-third":"Can the controller board (Zum Arduino, etc.) be programmed using Scratch?","landing-fifth-text-third":"There are two versions of Scratch ","landing-fifth-text-third-firstlink":"[S4A (Scratch for Arduino)","landing-fifth-text-third-secondlink":"[S2A (Scratch to Arduino)]","landing-fifth-text-title-third-second":" which allow interaction with a Zum or Arduino board Both versions can be used to read the sensors and actuate the servos, LEDs, etc. which are connected to the computer via USB. This means that electronics can be used in the Scratch programs in the same way as the keyboard and mouse. This feature is very useful, for example, it allows a video game to be controlled using the potentiometer or by switching on the LEDs.  However, if the controller board is disconnected or the computer shuts down, it will stop working, being merely another peripheral device which can interact with the video games. Bitbloq, on the other hand, is an authentic programming language. This means that the program created using blocks is compiled and uploaded to the controller board, so that even if it gets disconnected, it will continue to function, being on the board rather than the computer.","landing-fifth-footer":"If you have any queries or questions, you can write to us at ","landing-fifth-footer-link":"support-bitbloq@bq.com","landing-main-copyright":"Copyright Â© 2010-2014 Mundo Reader, S.L.

If you have already used the first version of Bitbloq, it will help you to get to know the new features, advantages and differences.\n\nIf you still haven´t installed the Web2Board application, which you will need to make your board and Bitbloq 2 function correctly, now is a good time. In Before you start with Bitbloq 2, you can find a step-by-step explanation of the process.\n","diwo_tutorial_3_title":"What is a robot? Getting to know sensors and actuators","diwo_tutorial_3_text":"The word \"robot\" comes from the Czech \"robota\", meaning forced or hard labour.  It was used for the first time in Karel Čapek´s play \"Rossum Universal Robots\" and its usage was extended through the science fiction works of Isaac Asimov.\n\nWe often imagine a robot as a machine with a human form, that walks, talks and makes gestures... but in reality it´s a lot more simple:\n\n“A robot is an programmable automated machine which can interpret information from the physical environment in order to adapt its behaviour. It has the capacity to interact with the environment and carry out different functions accordingly.”\n","diwo_tutorial_4_title":"And there was light: programming LEDs using Bitbloq 2","diwo_tutorial_4_text":"An LED (light-emitting diode) is a type of diode; a component which allows electricity to flow in one direction only and blocks it in the other. LEDs emit light when the current passes through.  LEDs are cheap, they don´t consume much power and they can produce a considerable amount of light. They are frequently used in electronic systems and are replacing traditional lighting.","diwo_tutorial_5_title":"If you tell me to come, I´ll leave everything, or I won´t. Conditional sentences and the push-button.","diwo_tutorial_5_text":"A conditional sentence involves asking a question, and responding one way or another according to the answer. For example, if it rains, I will use the umbrella. On the other hand, if it doesn´t rain, I won´t. If it´s cold, I´ll put my coat on. If it´s hot, I´ll take it off. It it gets dark, I´ll put the light on. On the other hand, if it gets light, I´ll turn it off. ","diwo_tutorial_6_title":"Communicating with other devices. The serial port.","diwo_tutorial_6_text":"The serial port is the means that enables your controller board to communicate with another device, such as your computer or mobile. It´s very useful for checking the value of a sensor or variable at a glance, seeing the status of your program and finally, for correcting and understanding any errors it might contain.","diwo_tutorial_7_title":"Programming with variables using Bitbloq 2","diwo_tutorial_7_text":"A variable is a value that can be stored safely and then retrieved when we need it. Imagine that it´s like a box that we will use to store some data, for example... an asparagus.\n\nWe will be able to see the value stored in the box and use it later on. If we don´t store this data in a variable, we won´t be able to reuse it, as the program won´t remember it. As we will see later, we can also change the value stored in the variable at any time.\n","diwo_tutorial_8_title":"Learn how to think like a robot! Algorithms","diwo_tutorial_8_text":"An algorithm is a set of highly specific and organised instructions to be followed in order to carry out a task. A few examples of some very simple algorithms would be a following a medical prescription, brushing your teeth, putting a load of washing on, etc.","diwo_tutorial_9_title":"Beeep... Programming the buzzer","diwo_tutorial_9_text":"The buzzer is a component which can produce sounds at different frequencies. They are used to produce signals or alerts in a wide range of systems, as well alarm clocks, doorbells and timers in home appliances (e.g. ovens), etc.","diwo_tutorial_10_title":"Black or white. The infrared sensor.","diwo_tutorial_10_text":"The infrared sensor, also known as IR sensor, is a device that detects the quantity of reflected light. It can therefore differentiate between black and white, or dark and light. There are many types of infrared sensor, such as the ones found in TV remote controls, object detection or even for measuring a person´s heart rate. The infrared sensor that we will be using is digital and will return 1 whenever white is detected, and 0 when black is detected.","diwo_tutorial_11_title":"Programming a potentiometer using Bitbloq 2","diwo_tutorial_11_text":"A potentiometer is a variable resistor, meaning a component that regulates the intensity of the electrical current in a circuit. They are used in many devices, for example, in lamps to regulate the light intensity, or in musical equipment to adjust the volume.\n\nAs with all analogue sensors, the potentiometer returns values between 0 and 1023.","diwo_tutorial_12_title":"Look towards the robot light... programming the light sensor","diwo_tutorial_12_text":"A light sensor is a resistor that adjusts its value according to the quantity of light.\n\nThe Zum kit light sensor returns values between 0 (total darkness) and 800 (total light). Remember that being an analogue component, it has to be connected to the pins marked A0, A1, A2, etc.\n","diwo_tutorial_13_title":"Loops, loops, loops, loops, loops, loops, loo… control loops","diwo_tutorial_13_text":"A control loop is a part of the program which is repeated while a condition is completed. For example, while it´s raining, I won´t go outside and I´ll read a good book. There are various types of control blocks that will be of use to us on different occasions.
